While playing with my son's toy clock I got to thinking about the relative angles between the minute and hour hands. On the toy clock the hands move independently of each other so you can make any configuration desired. On a real clock, of course, the relative position is specified by the time. 

For this analysis, let's look at the relative position of the hands over a 12-hour period to see if we see any patterns.

We start by importing the required libraries.
