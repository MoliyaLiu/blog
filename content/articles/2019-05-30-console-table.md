<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->

I built a simple console table to organize items by the back door.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->


## Design
I looked online for some ideas and found a number of good examples to work from.

My goal with this project was to use exclusively biscuit joints with no metal fasteners. I wanted a simple and quick build using wood I had on hand, which ended up being 1x4s and 1x2s.


## Build
### Materials Required

| Material | Quantity | Description | 
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| **1x4s** | 2 | top shelf, legs | 
| **1x2s** | 1 | feet | 
| **7/8” Screw-on gliders** | 4 | adjustible gliders to level | 
| **White Primer** | 1 gallon | Bulls Eye 1-2-3 Primer (1-coat) | 
| **White Paint** | 1 gallon | Valspar Optimus (1-coat) | 
| **Stain** | As required | Miniwax Cherry 235 | 
| **Lacquer** | As required | Deft Clear Wood Finish Satin | 
| **Wood Glue** | As required | Elmer's Wood Glue | 
| **Sandpaper** | As required | 120 and 220 grit | 


### Tools Required
- Miter saw
- Biscuit joiner
- Clamps
- Square
- Tape measure
- Sander
- Paint brushes
- Router

I started by cutting two 1x4s to length to form the top surface. I cut biscuit holes and then glued and clamped these. While the top dried, I cut the legs and feet, cut biscuit holes, and glued these up. When the tabletop was dry, I trimmed the ends and used a router to cut a nice edge.

I chose to stain the top and paint the remainder white. For stain I used Miniwax Cherry 235, finished with several coats of Deft Clear Wood Finish, which is the same finish I have been using for wood carvings as well. For the painted surfaces I primed with Bulls Eye 1-2-3 Primer, followed by a coat of Valspar Optimus paint.

The last step was to install 7/8” Screw-on gliders from ACE Hardware to level the table. Being very narrow it is not particularly stable and needs to be positioned near a wall.
